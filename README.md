> platformatic quick start demo app

## Install

```sh
yarn install
```

## Usage

```sh
yarn dev
```

## Deployment

This template comes with two GitHub Actions that handle automatically deploying your app to production and staging environments.

Prior to your first deployment, you'll need to do a few things:

- [Install Fly](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/)

- Sign up and log in to Fly

  ```sh
  fly auth signup
  ```

- Create a new app on Fly:

  ```sh
  fly apps create platformatic-starter
  ```

- Create a new [GitHub Repository](https://repo.new)

- Add a `FLY_API_TOKEN` to your GitHub repo. To do this, go to your user settings on Fly and create a new [token](https://web.fly.io/user/personal_access_tokens/new), then add it to [your repo secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) with the name `FLY_API_TOKEN`.

- Create a persistent volume for the sqlite database for both your app. Run the following:

  ```sh
  fly volumes create data --size 1 --app platformatic-starter
  ```

Now that every is set up you can commit and push your changes to your repo. Every commit to your `main` branch will trigger a deployment to your production environment.

## GitHub Actions

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Anything that gets into the `main` branch will be deployed to production after running tests/build/etc.
